# dotfiles

## about
manageable dotfiles

## copying/deployment
manually copy files into place

## updates and multiple machines
diverging is OK, apply useful departures back to repository with a diff tool

---

## missing stuff
no homebrew
no automatic chsh and /etc/shells addition
no oh-my-zsh
no nvm
no fzf
no man pages and gnu utils?
