# dotfiles

manageable dotfiles

## updates and multiple machines
diverging is OK, apply useful departures back to repository with a diff tool

### notes
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (don't install with homebrew)

## missing stuff
no automatic chsh and /etc/shells addition
no oh-my-zsh
no fzf
no man pages and gnu utils?
